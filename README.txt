# BusinessCardOcr

## Running

To run the cli, run "java -jar business-card-ocr-0.0.1.jar" in a command line interface at the same directory level as the jar. Make sure your JRE is up to date.

## How to Use

When running, type "input" to begin input mode. This will allow a business card to be pasted in the command line. Once you end it with an empty line, the parser will try to parse out the name, email, and phone number in the busuiness card you provided.

When out of input mode, type "exit" to exit.
